**Microservices with ALB - Terraform Infrastructure
**
**Overview
**
This repository provides a Terraform-based infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution to deploy a microservices architecture using AWS services. The architecture includes:

Application Load Balancer (ALB) with Path-Based Routing

EC2 Auto-Scaling Groups for scalable compute resources

AWS Lambda for serverless compute needs

Amazon Aurora and DynamoDB databases for storage

High availability and multi-AZ support

Secure VPC setup with public and private subnets

Multiple environments (Production, Development, QA, Staging)

**Components
**
VPC: Secure network with public and private subnets.

ALB: Manages traffic routing based on paths to different services.

Target Groups: Routes traffic to EC2 instances, Lambda, and Kubernetes.

Auto Scaling Groups: Ensures high availability and scalability for EC2.

Lambda: Serverless computing for microservices.

Aurora and DynamoDB: Databases for different services.

Security Groups: Provides firewall-level security.

**Prerequisites
**
Terraform: Install Terraform CLI from Terraform Download.

AWS CLI: Install AWS CLI and configure credentials.

IAM Role: Ensure you have permissions to create IAM roles, VPCs, EC2 instances, and RDS databases.

Terraform Backend: Setup S3 bucket and DynamoDB for remote state management.

Environments

The infrastructure is designed to support multiple environments:

Production

Development

QA

Staging

Use terraform.tfvars to define variables specific to each environment.

**Deployment Steps
**
**Clone Repository
**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name/terraform

Initialize Terraform

terraform init

Plan Changes

terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

Apply Changes

terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

Destroy Infrastructure (if required)

terraform destroy -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

**Outputs
**
After successful deployment, the ALB DNS name will be provided as output:

**Outputs:
**  alb_dns_name = "example-alb-12345678.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"

**Security Measures

Security groups enforce least privilege principles.

Database credentials are managed securely using environment variables.

Data in transit is secured using HTTPS.

Multi-AZ deployments ensure high availability and disaster recovery.

Access control policies implemented for IAM roles.

Monitoring & Logging

AWS CloudWatch is used for monitoring logs and performance metrics.

Alarms can be configured to notify admins of any failures.**
